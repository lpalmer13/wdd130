        <p>My major is Computer Science.</p>
        <p>In my free time when I'm home I enjoy riding my Sur Ron X ebike on off road trails and around town. I also enjoy working out at the gym and playing sports, as well as anything outdoors. </p>
        <p>I'm taking this course as part of my major. I took a web development class in high school, but it's been a few yours so I'd say I'm about a 3 or a 4 with web development. </p>
        <p>I've been a member of the church my whole life. One of my favorite scriptures is John 3:16 </p>
